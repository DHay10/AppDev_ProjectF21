## **Description**

- This GUI-based application is for the A21 Application Development Final Project.
- A student information system with database (SISD) will enable the school to track and manage all their student data, information, and progress. This will help a school with a huge population of students to better manage the student’s data. This information will be inputted by the user/school. The idea of this application is so the user has a fast way to acquire or update their student’s information without the need for a more complex program. Students’ information will be inputted by the user, and it will be saved in a CSV file (Comma Separated Values) that will later be ready to be treated by a more complex database management system.
